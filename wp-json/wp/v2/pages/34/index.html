At BeePizza, we want to make the most delicious pizza EVER! To make that happen, we do a lot of research. It took us a long time to find the right flour mix to make sure the dough was just right. We looked all over the place. From the rich soil of Da Lat, we found the sweetest and ripest tomatoes which taste like Italian one. These tomatoes are chosen especially just for us. They are the base for our own secret sauce. We top it all off with the best mozzarella (no high-fat cheese here) and the best, freshest toppings, and then we put it on our signature pizza. Those unique things make BeePizza become special<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/image_2022-03-29_165214-1010x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-138\" width=\"398\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/image_2022-03-29_165214-1010x1024.png 1010w, http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/image_2022-03-29_165214-296x300.png 296w, http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/image_2022-03-29_165214-768x779.png 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/image_2022-03-29_165214-510x517.png 510w, http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/image_2022-03-29_165214-100x100.png 100w, http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/image_2022-03-29_165214.png 1144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mission:<\/strong><br>Working hard as a team to bring the best pizza and services to our beloved customers while helping the Vietnamese farmers to promote production and stabilize their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vision:<\/strong><br>In order to complete our mission, we have developed a set of goals:<br>People: by offering a great place to work, we can train and inspire one another to be our best selves.<br>Product: provide a variety of products\/services that anticipate, establish, and satisfy customers&#8217; wants and needs, both obvious and hidden.<br>CSR: To provide ethical and responsible products and services while taking into account all aspects of the business environment and societal well-being.<br>Relationship: form a stakeholder alliance to achieve common goals and mutual advantages.<br>To the nation: promote economic development by using high quality ingredients across Vietnam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be a Bee<\/strong>: Beelieve Pizza is a place where anyone who enjoys pizza can express themselves and be creative.
