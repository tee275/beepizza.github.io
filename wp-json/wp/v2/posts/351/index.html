But\u2026 if you are making all of the components from scratch (which I highly recommend!) it will take a little longer. The good thing is that much of it can be made in advance!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The Teriyaki<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 my homemade teriyaki chicken\u00a0is perfect in this recipe. It\u2019s more like a glaze because it is quite thick, which is what you\u2019ll need for this recipe. It can be made even a few days in advance, plus you\u2019ll have extra to use in other recipes, as well.<\/li><li><strong>The Pizza Dough<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 I have been making my\u00a0homemade pizza dough\u00a0almost weekly for years now. You could definitely use a store bought crust, but I have a feeling that if you tried my homemade dough, you\u2019d be hooked, too! I will usually make the dough earlier in the morning for dinner that night, but really, you could make it a day ahead of time and put it in the refrigerator (be careful, though, as it will continue to rise, just not as fast) or you could freeze portions so that you just have to defrost your dough that day. Make sure and read through my post for all of the tips for making the pizza dough. I know it\u2019s long, but it is all important information!<\/li><li><strong>The Chicken<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 All you really need to do is cut and cook the chicken, and this will just take a few minutes, especially since it\u2019s not a lot of chicken. Technically you could do this ahead of time, as well, but it\u2019s so quick that it\u2019s really not necessary!<\/li><li><strong>The Pineapple<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 I have used both fresh and canned pineapple in this recipe before. While I definitely prefer the flavor of fresh, canned will work. You may need to cut the pieces smaller, though, so that you don\u2019t have big chunks of pineapple on your pizza.<\/li><li><strong>The Rest<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Cheese and cilantro are the last two ingredients you\u2019ll need. I recommend freshly grated Mozzarella, as it will melt better. You don\u2019t necessarily need fresh mozzarella, though \u2013 I just use the brick of cheese from the grocery store. Pre-grated cheese is coated to keep it from sticking together, and this makes it so that it doesn\u2019t melt as well. For the cilantro \u2013 I know some people don\u2019t like it, so you can leave it off. But I love the bit of freshness and flavor it brings.<\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This pizza in and of itself doesn\u2019t take a ton [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[69],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/351"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=351"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/351\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":354,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/351\/revisions\/354"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=351"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=351"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/beepizza\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=351"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
